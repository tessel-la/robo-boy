A vibe web application for controlling ROS 2 robots, featuring a React frontend, ROS 2 integration via rosbridge, and secure local development setup with Caddy and HTTPS. Inspired by retro handheld consoles.

## ‚ú® Features

*   üì± Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
*   üîó ROS 2 connection (via rosbridge).
*   üì∑ Camera stream display (via web_video_server).
*   üïπÔ∏è Gamepad-style joystick control (publishing `sensor_msgs/Joy`).
*   üó£Ô∏è Voice control input with recording animation.
*   üßä 3D visualization support (using ros3djs).
*   üåó Animated Light/Dark mode toggle.
*   üõ°Ô∏è Local HTTPS development setup via Caddy and mkcert.

## Theme Customization

The application supports multiple themes, including user-created custom themes. Themes define the color palette for the UI elements.

### Creating & Managing Themes

1.  **Access Theme Menu:** Click the theme icon button (usually in the bottom-right corner). This opens a popup menu displaying available themes (default and custom).

    </p>

2.  **Create New Theme:** Click the "Create New Theme..." button in the popup. This opens the Theme Creator modal.

    </p>

3.  **Define Theme:**
    *   Enter a unique **Name** for your theme.
    *   Select the base **Colors** (Primary, Secondary, Background) using the color pickers. Optional colors (Text, Border, etc.) can also be set.
    *   Choose an **Icon** to represent your theme in the selector menu.
    *   Click **Save Theme**.

4.  **Editing/Deleting:** Custom themes will have Edit (pencil) and Delete (trash) icons next to them in the theme selector popup. Clicking Edit opens the Theme Creator pre-filled with that theme's settings. Clicking Delete prompts for confirmation before removing the theme.

### How it Works

*   Default themes (`light`, `dark`, `solarized`) have their CSS variables defined directly in `src/index.css` using `[data-theme="themename"]` selectors.
*   Custom themes are stored in the browser's `localStorage`.
*   When a custom theme is selected, JavaScript dynamically generates a `<style>` tag containing CSS variable overrides based on the saved colors and injects it into the document head. The `<body>` element also gets a `data-theme="custom-theme-id"` attribute.
*   UI components should primarily use the defined CSS variables (e.g., `var(--primary-color)`, `var(--background-color)`) for styling to ensure they adapt correctly to the selected theme. 

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 LTS or later recommended) and npm. (*Note: Node/npm are technically only needed if modifying dependencies locally before a Docker build, but good to have.*)
*   [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation) for local HTTPS setup.

### Local Development Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd robo-boy # Or your actual directory name
    ```

2.  **Setup Local HTTPS with mkcert:**
    *   **Install mkcert's CA:** Run this once per machine to make browsers trust local certificates.
        ```bash
        mkcert -install 
        ```
        *(You might need `sudo` or administrator privileges)*
    *   **Create Certificates Directory:**
        ```bash
        mkdir certs
        ```
    *   **Generate Certificate:** Replace `YOUR_HOST_IP` with your computer's actual local network IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.67`). This certificate will be valid for `localhost` and your IP.
        ```bash
        mkcert -key-file certs/local-key.pem -cert-file certs/local-cert.pem localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1 YOUR_HOST_IP
        ```

3.  **Build and Run Services:** This command builds the Docker images (if they don't exist or need updating) and starts the `app` (React Vite dev server), `ros-stack` (rosbridge, web_video_server), and `caddy` (reverse proxy) containers.
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --build
    ```

4.  **Access the Application:**
    *   On your development machine: `https://localhost`
    *   From another device on the same network (e.g., mobile): `https://YOUR_HOST_IP` (using the same IP you used for `mkcert`)

### Stopping the Services

```bash
# Stop and remove containers
docker compose down

# Stop, remove containers, AND remove Caddy's data volumes (useful for a clean restart)
docker compose down -v 
```

## üê≥ Services Overview

*   **`app`**: Runs the Vite development server for the React frontend with hot-reloading.
    *   Accessible *internally* at `http://app:5173`.
*   **`ros-stack`**: Runs ROS 2 components.
    *   `rosbridge_server`: Provides WebSocket connection at `ws://ros-stack:9090`.
    *   `web_video_server`: Streams video topics over HTTP at `http://ros-stack:8080`.
*   **`caddy`**: Acts as a reverse proxy.
    *   Listens on host ports `80` and `443`.
    *   Provides HTTPS using the generated `mkcert` certificates.
    *   Routes `/websocket` requests to `ros-stack:9090`.
    *   Routes all other requests to the Vite dev server (`app:5173`).

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

*   Changes to frontend code (in `/src`) should trigger hot-reloading in the browser.
*   If you modify `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, or `Caddyfile`, you'll need to rebuild and restart the services (`docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate`).
*   Caddy logs can be viewed with `docker compose logs caddy`.
*   ROS stack logs can be viewed with `docker compose logs ros-stack`.
