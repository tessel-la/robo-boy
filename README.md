# 🤖 Robot-Boy

A vibe web application for controlling ROS 2 robots, featuring a React frontend, ROS 2 integration via rosbridge, and secure local development setup with Caddy and HTTPS.

## ✨ Features

*   📱 Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
*   🔗 ROS 2 connection (via rosbridge).
*   📷 Camera stream display (via web_video_server).
*   🕹️ Gamepad-style joystick control.
*   🗣️ (Planned) Voice control input.
*   🧊 (Planned) 3D visualization (using ros3djs).
*   🌗 Light/Dark mode toggle.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 LTS or later recommended) and npm.
*   [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#installation) for local HTTPS setup.

### Local Development Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd robot-web-controller 
    ```

2.  **Setup Local HTTPS with mkcert:**
    *   **Install mkcert's CA:** Run this once per machine to make browsers trust local certificates.
        ```bash
        mkcert -install 
        ```
        *(You might need `sudo` or administrator privileges)*
    *   **Create Certificates Directory:**
        ```bash
        mkdir certs
        ```
    *   **Generate Certificate:** Replace `YOUR_HOST_IP` with your computer's actual local network IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.67`). This certificate will be valid for `localhost` and your IP.
        ```bash
        mkcert -key-file certs/local-key.pem -cert-file certs/local-cert.pem localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1 YOUR_HOST_IP
        ```

3.  **Build and Run Services:** This command builds the Docker images (if they don't exist) and starts the `app` (React Vite dev server), `ros-stack` (rosbridge, web_video_server), and `caddy` (reverse proxy) containers.
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --build
    ```

4.  **Access the Application:**
    *   On your development machine: `https://localhost`
    *   From another device on the same network (e.g., mobile): `https://YOUR_HOST_IP` (using the same IP you used for `mkcert`)

### Stopping the Services

```bash
# Stop and remove containers
docker compose down

# Stop, remove containers, AND remove Caddy's data volumes (useful for a clean restart)
docker compose down -v 
```

## 🐳 Services Overview

*   **`app`**: Runs the Vite development server for the React frontend with hot-reloading.
    *   Accessible *internally* at `http://app:5173`.
*   **`ros-stack`**: Runs ROS 2 components.
    *   `rosbridge_server`: Provides WebSocket connection at `ws://ros-stack:9090`.
    *   `web_video_server`: Streams video topics over HTTP at `http://ros-stack:8080`.
*   **`caddy`**: Acts as a reverse proxy.
    *   Listens on host ports `80` and `443`.
    *   Provides HTTPS using the generated `mkcert` certificates.
    *   Routes `/websocket` requests to `ros-stack:9090`.
    *   Routes all other requests to the Vite dev server (`app:5173`).

## 🛠️ Development Notes

*   Changes to frontend code (in `/src`) should trigger hot-reloading in the browser.
*   If you modify `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, or `Caddyfile`, you'll need to rebuild and restart the services (`docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate`).
*   Caddy logs can be viewed with `docker compose logs caddy`.
*   ROS stack logs can be viewed with `docker compose logs ros-stack`.
